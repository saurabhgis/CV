# cmv-calcite-maps

This repo combines [CMV](https://github.com/cmv/cmv-app) with Esri's [Calcite Maps](https://github.com/esri/calcite-maps/). Calcite Maps is "A theme for [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com/) for designing, styling and creating modern map apps." The Esri repository provides documentation on the Calcite Maps CSS and JavaScript files.

## Implementation
There are very few changes needed to use Calcite Maps. The majority of the customizations are within the HTML page. See the [example](./demo.html). In addition, you will need to include the new [_CalciteMixin.js](./config/_CalciteMixin.js) in [app.js](./config/app.js). A CSS file [cmv-calcite.css](./css/cmv-calcite.css) is included which helps with the styling of your CMV application.

##[Demo](https://cmv.github.io/cmv-calcite-maps/demo.html)
The demo in this repo [includes](./config/viewer.js) many core CMV widgets as well as a custom [Styler widget](widgets/CalciteStyler.js) adapted from Calcite Maps. You can use this widget to experiment with the different theme styles and colors.

It is expected that many of the [contributed CMV widgets](https://github.com/cmv/cmv-contrib-widgets) and widgets for Esri's Web AppBuilder (Using the method documented in [this repo](https://github.com/cmv/cmv-wab-widgets)) should work without modification though few have been tested at this point. Widgets that use a full pane like the [Attributes Table widget](https://github.com/tmcgee/cmv-widgets#attributes-tables) are not currently supported though hopefully will be in the near future.

## Mobile
One of the strengths of using Calcite Maps is the responsive design provided by the Bootstrap framework.
